#### Changing the save location (TBU)
The application data are saved in a file called `database.json` in the project root folder.
You can change the location by specifying the file path as a program argument.<br>

> The file name must end in `.json` for it to be acceptable to the program.
>
> When running the program inside Eclipse, you can [set command line parameters before running the program](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7574543/how-to-pass-console-arguments-to-application-in-eclipse).
